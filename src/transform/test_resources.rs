pub const MULTIPLE_KATEX_STR: &'static str = r#"Let the third-order Taylor series approximation of $T_1(t)$ be the cubic
function $g(t)=at^3+bt^2+ct+d$. The blue function on the graph is the Taylor
series approximation of it. I decided that the simulator would have 16
increments, so the actual function used is $g(t)$ rescaled to $[0,16]$ centered
