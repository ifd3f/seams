## Introduction

When I was taking Computer Architecture, I needed an FPGA for the class, and a
[Basys 3](https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/)
in particular. In any other year, I would have probably borrowed it from Cal
Poly to take computer architecture. However, due to the pandemic, I had to spend
money and buy it myself. That thing is $150 - it ain't cheap!

Now that class is over, I had this board and I wanted to do something with it. I
didn't want to do something that any ordinary microcontroller could do because
that's boring, in that case I would just use a microcontroller. No, I wanted to
make something that _requires_ a FPGA.

So, I thought of making a direct sampling software-defined radio. It won't have
a transmit function, only a receive function, because I have no idea how to do
power electronics. Its main purpose would be basically as an ultra wide band
scanner (I'm thinking of trying to make it scan a 50 MHz section all at once).

## Problem parameters

The FPGA has a **100 MHz internal clock** for most computations, and I want to
scan the spectrum of frequencies **between 125 and 175 MHz.** Therefore, by the
Nyquist-Shannon theorem, I will need at least twice that - 325 MSPS (million
samples per second) coming in.

I've figured out a possible way to get **400 MSPS at an 8 bit resolution** into
the FPGA. This involves going above 100 MHz, and this will likely be elaborated
on in the future. But for now, we'll just assume for now that that's the data
stream coming in. So, every 100 MHz clock, we get 4 x 8-bit samples. We are
dealing with a theoretical data rate of 3.2 Gbps, and _this_ is why we need an
FPGA.

## Generating a "raw signal"

Let's make a signal with lots of different frequency components that we can use
for experimenting with. It should reveal why we need to pre-process the signal
before FFT.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Configuration so that y'all actually see this stuff
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [11, 7]

M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND = 400
SAMPLES_PER_SECOND = M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND * 1e6
NYQUIST = SAMPLES_PER_SECOND / 2
SIGNAL_LENGTH = 10e-3
FFT_SIZE = 4096

# Time domain (1 index = 1 sample at 400 MSPS)
time = np.linspace(0, SIGNAL_LENGTH, SIGNAL_LENGTH * SAMPLES_PER_SECOND)

def tone(x):
    return np.cos(x * time * 2 * np.pi)

def fm_tone(x, carrier, deviation):
    return np.cos(carrier * time * 2 * np.pi + deviation * np.sin(x * time * 2 * np.pi))

def am_tone(x, carrier):
    return (1 + np.cos(x * time * 2 * np.pi)) * np.cos(carrier * time * 2 * np.pi)

received_signal = 5 * tone(125e6)
received_signal += 5 * tone(175e6)
received_signal += 10 * am_tone(5e3, 150e6)
received_signal += fm_tone(100e3, 135e6, 0.25)

# Add in some unwanted tones
received_signal += 5 * tone(100e6)
received_signal += 100 * tone(120e6)
received_signal += 0.5 * fm_tone(800, 180e6, 4e3)
received_signal += 4 * fm_tone(250, 50e6, 1e5)

# An increasing frequency tone to act as an indicator
received_signal += 3 * np.cos((time * 100e6 / SIGNAL_LENGTH) * time * 2 * np.pi)

# Add in some noise for the heck of it
received_signal += np.random.normal(0, 1, len(time))

bin_size_0 = 1000 * M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND / 2 / FFT_SIZE

plt.specgram(received_signal, FFT_SIZE, M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND)
print(f'Bin size: {bin_size_0:02.3f} kHz')

plt.title(f"Full signal ({bin_size_0:02.3f} kHz bins)")
plt.ylabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.xlabel('time (us)')
plt.show()
```

    Bin size: 48.828 kHz

Once again, we only care about the 125-175MHz range! We don't care about
anything outside of that! So, all those wonky sine waves I added in are
essentially junk data.

Notice that the bin size is 50 kHz. Extremely thick. Narrowband FM on a Baofeng
UV-5R is 12.5kHz, and it's likely even smaller for other radios. We won't be
able to see individual channels, just a group of 4 channels or more.

This is the motivation behind preprocessing the signal. We want to essentially
zoom in on the 125-175MHz range so that our FFT can be much more precise for the
same amount of computation.

## Shifting the signal downwards

### Bandpass

First, we apply a bandpass filter with cutoffs at 120MHz and 180MHz. They are
somewhat offset from the frequencies we want so that we have a little buffer
space at the ends.

```python
from scipy import signal

bp_filter = signal.butter(
    32,
    [120e6 / NYQUIST, 180e6 / NYQUIST],
    'band',
    analog=False,
    output='sos'
)
w, h = signal.sosfreqz(bp_filter, fs=400)
plt.plot(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))
plt.title("Frequency response of the bandpass filter")
plt.ylabel('response (dB)')
plt.xlabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.show()
```

```python
bp_sig = signal.sosfilt(bp_filter, received_signal)
plt.specgram(bp_sig, FFT_SIZE, M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND)
plt.title("Post-Bandpass Signal")
plt.ylabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.xlabel('time (us)')
plt.show()
```

### Mixing for Shifting

Next, we mix with a 115MHz signal. For a signal with frequency $f$, this should
produce two signals, one at $f - 115\text{MHz}$, and the other reflected at
$115\text{MHz} - (f - 115\text{MHz})$.

```python
mixed = bp_sig * np.cos(115e6 * 2 * np.pi * time)

plt.specgram(mixed, FFT_SIZE, M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND)
plt.title("Post-mixing signal")
plt.ylabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.xlabel('time (us)')
plt.show()
```

### Lowpass

We now perform a low pass to keep the low-frequency signal and get rid of its
evil high-frequency twin. The 10-60MHz range here is the equivalent of the
original's 125-175MHz range, so we'll do a 65MHz lowpass.

```python
lp_filter = signal.butter(
    27,
    65e6 / NYQUIST,
    'lowpass',
    output='sos'
)
w, h = signal.sosfreqz(lp_filter, fs=400)
plt.plot(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))
plt.title("Frequency response of the lowpass filter")
plt.ylabel('response (dB)')
plt.xlabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.show()
```

```python
lp_sig = signal.sosfilt(lp_filter, mixed)
plt.specgram(lp_sig, FFT_SIZE, M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND)
plt.title("Post-lowpass signal")
plt.ylabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.xlabel('time (us)')
plt.show()
```

### Decimation

Finally, we decimate to get rid of what we don't want. Decimating by a factor of
3 means that the frequencies included here are between 0-67MHz post-mixing,
which is 120-177MHz on the original.

```python
decimate = signal.decimate(lp_sig, 3)
bin_size_1 = 1000 * (M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND / 3) / 2 / FFT_SIZE

plt.specgram(decimate, FFT_SIZE, M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND / 3)

plt.title(f"Post-decimate signal ({bin_size_1:02.3f} kHz)")
plt.ylabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.xlabel('time (us)')
plt.show()

print(f'Bin size (no pre-processing): {bin_size_0} kHz')
print(f'Bin size (with pre-processing): {bin_size_1:02.3f} kHz')
```

![png](https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/nyaabucket/309db810cf01e6f10582dec83a5a415ab969afc65cb1b9b5541fd3b0e92a7875/freq-shift_11_0.png)

    Bin size (no pre-processing): 48.828125 kHz
    Bin size (with pre-processing): 16.276 kHz

### Cutting off the edges

You can see how the sub-120 MHz signals get aliased in by the "checkmark" over
the 1500 tick. This is why we want padding below 125MHz and above 175MHz.
However, the aliasing stays below 10 MHz on this spectrogram (125 MHz on the
original). So, we'll just zoom in on the center and pretend the upper and lower
bands don't exist and pretend the axes are the correct "original" values.

```python
plt.specgram(decimate, FFT_SIZE, M_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND / 3)
plt.ylim([10, 60])
plt.title("Final signal that we will use")
plt.ylabel('frequency (MHz)')
plt.xlabel('time (us)')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

In this post we have designed a method of pre-processing a signal so that
performing a FFT on it later will be more precise and have smaller bins. If I
continue working on this project, I'll post updates and make a project page for
it.
