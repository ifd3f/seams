For my CSC 572 final project, I implemented a 3D rigid-body physics engine.
Naturally, the problem of n-body collisions arises and we need to figure out
what to do about them. Here are notes I wrote about my implementation.

## Structs

Particles are spheres. They essentially contain the following information:

- mass $$m$$
- radius $$r$$
- moment of inertia
- position vector $$s$$
- velocity vector $$v$$
- rotation matrix $$R$$
- angular velocity vector $$\omega$$ (right-hand rule, scaled to angular
  velocity in radians)

Contacts essentially contain the following information:

- a reference to the two particles, A and B. A and B both contain references to
  the contact, as well.
- the position where it happened $$P$$
- the **contact normal** $$n$$, which is a vector from B to A, with length equal
  to the penetration depth
- a state value that says if this contact is stable or not

Every loop, we calculate our list of contacts. This, along with gravity
calculation, are the most computationally expensive operations simply due to it
being $$O(n^2)$$ operations, so they are offloaded onto the GPU.

## Calculating our list of contacts

This is a $$O(n^2)$$ operation that just checks if two particles are
intersecting. If they are, it pushes a new contact onto the list `contacts`. We
are currently working on parallelizing it on the GPU.

## n-body contact solving

Once we have our list of contacts `contacts`, to take care of the n-body case,
we essentially do the following in pseudo code:

```
repeat contacts.size() times:
    for contact in contacts:
        contact.solve_momentum()
```

where `contact.solve_momentum()` takes care of the 2-body case described
[here](#2-body-problem).

Solving contacts multiple times takes care of cases like the Newton's Cradle.
This may seem inefficient in theory because if there's $$n$$ particles, there
might be $$n^2$$ contacts and thus $$n^3$$ calls for `solve_momentum()`.
However, in practice, most particles spend most of their time floating around
freely so momentum calculations can be safely done on the CPU, and this step
ends up only taking <10% of total processing time.

### Example

Suppose you have a bunch of balls in a line like this:

```
Velocity  |  > ....
Balls     |  o oooo
```

where `>`, `<`, and `.` are right, left, and zero respectively. We expect this
situation to end up like this:

```
.... >
oooo o
```

So, by running it iteratively, we can propagate the momentum through the chain:

```
Before
   > ....
   o oooo

1.  >....
    ooooo

2.  .>...
    ooooo

3.  ..>..
    ooooo

4.  ...>.
    ooooo

5.  ....>
    ooooo

After
    .... >
    oooo o
```

The number of iterations could be tuned, or calculated in a smarter way (I was
thinking, maybe calculate contacts within contiguous groups that are all
touching each other to reduce the number of iterations) but it works well enough
for our purposes.

## 2-body problem

### Momentum

If two balls are leaving each other, or if they have low relative velocity/the
contact is marked as "stable," then there is no momentum or friction to be
applied.

The 3D momentum problem gets reduced to a 1D momentum problem along the
collision normal $$n$$. So, we use $$v \cdot n$$ as our velocity and plug it
into the conservation of momentum equation with restitution derived
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution#Derivation).

### Friction

From the final momenta, we derive the impulse $$I$$. Multiplying $$I$$ by some
arbitrary coefficient approximates the normal force $$F_n$$, giving us the
magnitude of friction $$|f| = \mu F_n$$ where $$\mu$$ is the coefficient of
friction.

Next, we need to calculate the relative surface velocity of the particles.
Suppose we were only looking at a single particle. The contact point is
essentially undergoing two movements:

- it is moving at $$v$$, the particle's translational velocity
- it is moving along the particle's surface due to rotation, or
  $$\omega \times (P - s)$$

So, the surface velocity at the contact point of a single particle is
$$v + \omega \times (P - s)$$. The relative surface velocity $$\Delta v_{surf}$$
is just the difference between the two particles' surface velocities at the
contact point.

However, friction can only happen tangentially to the normal, so the direction
of friction is actually in the direction of
$$\Delta v_{surf} - proj_n(\Delta v_{surf})$$ (its orthogonal component).
Normalize this, and multiply by the magnitude derived earlier, and we have our
final friction.
