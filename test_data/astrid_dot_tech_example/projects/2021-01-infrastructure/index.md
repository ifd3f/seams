This project represents my unified efforts to manage all my software
configurations and deployments across all my machines.

## Principles

In designing and building my homelab, I try to adhere to several core principles
as much as I possibly can:

- **[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).**
  If a configuration can be expressed as repeatable, reproducible code, it
  probably should be.
- **Automation.** If I keep doing the same thing over and over again, I should
  probably automate it.
- **Emphasize security.** Getting hacked is scary and has real-life consequences
  in the real world. So, I want to avoid getting hacked as much as possible by
  taking a mildly paranoid approach to security.
- **Use standard tools as much as possible.** This lab is here for me to learn
  how people in the industry do things. Just as dev should mirror prod, my
  attempts here should mirror actual corporate environments.

## Current Infrastructure Setup

I'm currently at college, but I've brought my homelab with me. This means my
homelab spans two physical sites!

### Networking

#### DNS

I own many domain names, and they can become somewhat of a burden to maintain.
As such, I have them all centrally managed through Cloudflare. Furthermore, to
improve auditability and adhere to IaC best practices, I manage these domains
through Terraform. They are automatically deployed by Terraform Cloud on every
push to the monorepo.

#### Cascaded Routers

This is a setup I use whenever I have roommates. We have a router for the rest
of the house, and I have a router specifically for my room. Just like Texas with
ERCOT!

![The Texas power grid compared to the rest of US/Canada.](https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/nyaabucket/85c9534d527f670a3a319847c9f1626a9adbd524b61fcab9e7e40eadd4c8be41/ercot.jpg)

The reason I do this is so that I don't accidentally break the rest of the LAN
with my shenanigans. In other words, I expect that I'll end up like Texas, but
I'm trying to prevent the problems from reaching everyone else.

![Pictured: my network segment when I accidentally knock down the DNS.](https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/nyaabucket/1c097d4ce80fd999e803da03a28893ac9c80e6bdd4ef06e1f617b6174ba46602/texas-snowstorm.jpg)

Now, this does make setup slightly more of a hassle, especially with the problem
of port forwarding, but that's acceptable.

#### List of sites

- **Site 0:** This is my home in the Bay Area. Much of the equipment has been
  migrated to SLO, so there is not much equipment here. It has a cascaded router
  setup.
- **Site 1:** This is my apartment in San Luis Obispo (SLO) where I go to
  school. It also has a cascaded router setup.

### Personal Computers

#### BANANA

This is my usually-stay-at-home laptop with the following specs:

- **Hostname:** banana.id.astrid.tech
- **Location:** Wherever I go, but usually Site 1
- **Model:** Lenovo Legion Y530-15ICH-1060
- **OS:** Dual Boot: NixOS, Windows 10
- **CPU:** Intel i5-8300H (8 core)
- **RAM:** 32GiB
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 Mobile
- **Monitors:** 1920x1080 built-in + 2560x1440, 3840x2160
- **Storage:** 1TB nVMe SSD + 500GB SATA SSD
  - Windows is installed on the 1TB nVMe
  - NixOS is installed on an encrypted ZFS pool on the 1TB nVMe
  - /home is on an encrypted ZFS pool on the 500GB SSD
- **VM Guests**
  - **winana:** A Windows 10 VM for when I'm too darn lazy to reboot into full
    Windows 10.
  - **parrot-htb:** A Parrot OS VM for working on HackTheBox puzzles.

I do not intend to upgrade this to Windows 11.

#### Cracktop

Cracktop is my travel laptop that I bring to and from school. It was my old
laptop from high school.

- **Hostname:** cracktop-pc.id.astrid.tech
- **Location:** Wherever I go
- **Model:** HP Pavilion 13 x360
- **OS:** NixOS Unstable
- **CPU:** Intel i5-6300U (4 core)
- **RAM:** 8GiB
- **Monitors:** 1920x1080
- **Storage:** 128GB M.2 SATA SSD

There are a couple reasons why I use it despite its cracked screen:

- It's a lot lighter than BANANA, which reduces the load in my backpack.
- Campus has a bike theft problem, so I wouldn't be surprised if it had a device
  theft problem as well. If I lose this machine, I won't be too sad, and with
  the cracked screen, no one would want to steal it.

### Workload Servers

#### Bongus

This server was an absolute steal I got off of eBay for \$200.

- **Hostname:** bongus-hv.id.astrid.tech
- **Location:** Site 1
- **Model:** HP ProLiant DL380P Gen8
- **OS:** NixOS Unstable
- **CPU:** 2x Intel Xeon (2x8 phys. core, 2x16 virt. core)
- **RAM:** 96GiB
- **Storage:** 128GB SATA SSD + RAID1 2x 1TB Used HDD
  - NixOS is installed on an encrypted ZFS pool on the 128GB SSD
  - The RAID1 HDDs are used for ZFS datasets containing miscellaneous data

Unfortunately, it eats a lot of power, so I'm only turning it on sporadically
when I need to heat my room.

### Dedicated Devices

Entire bare-metal devices dedicated to a single purpose. These are usually
low-power single-board computers (SBCs) that are always on, but have a workload
that essentially requires the entire device.

#### APRS I-Gate

A dedicated device for decoding and uploading
[APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) signals
around Site 0. Created because
[there is poor APRS coverage where I live](https://astrid.tech/2021/11/21/1/aprs-walk/).

- **Location:** Site 0
- **Model:** Orange Pi One
- **OS:** Armbian
- **CPU:** Allwinner H3 (4 core)
- **RAM:** 512MB
- **Peripherals**
  - [RTL-SDR](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-mini.html)
    (USB 2.0)

#### Jump Servers

Jump servers are Raspberry Pis with an SSH server exposed to the Internet. These
are used to send Wake-on-LAN packets to other machines. Both Sites 0 and 1 are
equipped with one of these:

- **jonathan-js:** Raspberry Pi 3 at Site 1
- **joseph-js:** Raspberry Pi 3 at Site 0

However, I intend to set up Wireguard VPN so I don't have to expose them, so I
can relegate these to a Wake-on-LAN-plus-other-stuff role.

### Public Cloud

I have 2 Always Free VPSes in Oracle Cloud. Only 1 is in use right now. The
other will eventually become my Wireguard VPN lighthouse.

#### oci1

I run the astrid.tech backend on this one. It is managed through Docker Compose,
and refreshed hourly using an Ansible Playbook hosted in Github Actions.

#### Future Expansion Plans

- I plan on setting up a Wireguard VPN, with an Oracle Cloud VPS as the primary
  connection endpoint.
- I want to set up a new Kubernetes cluster. Don't let all those YAMLs from the
  past go to waste, after all!

## History

This is the history of my attempts at system administration.

### v0 - Early Forays

In late 2017, I was interested in trading Bitcoin. But not just going about it
in a boring way; I wanted to algorithmically trade it, and use computers to
calculate the optimal trading strategy. But I didn't just want to calculate that
strategy the normal way, either, I wanted to write a genetic algorithm to do it.
And it didn't just stop there, I wanted to run it on multiple computers to do
parallel processing.

So, I spent \$50 on a pair of Dell Optiplexes from eBay, hooked them into my
LAN, installed Ubuntu Server on them, and tried to set up
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) on them. What could possibly go wrong?

```dot
graph {
    rankdir = LR
    node [shape = cube]
    powerline [shape = oval]
    wifi [shape = oval]
    router -- "mom's computer", wifi, powerline
    powerline -- switch -- desktop, "server-alpha", "server-beta"
    wifi -- laptop, "RPi jump server/octoprint" [style=dashed]
}
```

The issue is, at the time, I was more of a programmer, and I saw deployment as
an implementation detail that could be sorted out later. So, I did it the very
quick and dirty way (wget the zip, call it via SSH) without really learning
about modern best practices.

Well, what ended up happening was I never got any of that working. I didn't know
about tools like Ansible, Docker, or Nix at the time, and deploying in the prod
environment over SSH was every bit as frustrating and tedious as I thought it
would be. Additionally, it turns out you can't just make a modern algotrader
only relying on technical indicators, so that failed too. However, this
experiment did set the stage for my future DevOps endeavors.

### v1 - VPS Deployment

In late December 2020, I was writing the backend for
[astrid.tech](/projects/astrid-tech), and I came across the problem of "how do I
deploy this?" And that's [when I learned Docker](/2020/12/27/0), and my VPS had
excess capacity, so I
[hosted some other stuff besides my backend using Docker](/2021/01/18/selfhost).

I consider this v1 of my homelab because it was something actually functional
for a while. Although the service declarations were in a sort of modular Docker
Compose architecture, they were all updated manually by SSHing in and
essentially running `git pull && docker-compose up`.
[Here is the last version of the configs](https://github.com/ifd3f/infra/tree/v1-final)
before I incorporated it into the rest of my monorepo.

### v2 - On-Premises Cloud

Running a budgeting application like Firefly III in a public cloud alongside my
website backend (a prime target for hacking!) seemed like a bit of a liability.
So, I wanted to move that to a private, on-site cloud composed of multiple
computers. It seemed awkward to manually allocate services to specific ones,
[so that led me to learn Kubernetes](/2021/01/21/janky-kube-cluster).

It was mostly set up manually, with a few Ansible scripts to semi-automate tasks
like upgrading software, and a few Terraform configs to create databases.
[Here is what the infra repo looked like by the time I set up v2.](https://github.com/ifd3f/infra/tree/v2-final)

#### On-Site Hardware

#### Public Cloud

I continued to use public cloud resources. I ran a Minecraft server on Contabo
for a time, and I continued to run parts of v1 stack on oci-1.

| Name      | Provider | Price ($/mo) | Arch  | Processor      | Cores | RAM (GB) | Role                |

#### End-User Services

These were the services I actually ran, and some I planned on running but never
ended up getting done in v2.

Of course, in Kubernetes, every service gets its own Ingress. However, these are
internal services so it seems like somewhat of an antipattern to add A records
pointing to 192.168.xxx.xxx in Cloudflare. My solution to this was just to add
janky entries to my /etc/hosts and "fix it later"
([in v2 of my homelab](/2021/04/17/0/k8s-freeipa-dns)):

```
192.168.1.xxx firefly.astrid.tech grafana.astrid.tech prometheus.astrid.tech ...
```

[^fn-1]:
    My mom complained about it being really slow, and even with Linux, it's
    still slow. Thus, it's worse than crap.

[^fn-2]:
    This is my old laptop. I pulled it out of my backpack one day and saw the
    screen completely cracked for no good reason whatsoever.

[^fn-3]: :thinking: https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/thonk.png
[^fn-4]:
    Zerg rushing is essentially the "quantity-over-quality" tactic in strategy
    games: you send many expendable units against the enemy to hopefully
    overwhelm them.

#### Monitoring Services

And finally, these were the services I used to monitor all of the above.

```dot
digraph {
    rankdir=LR
    subgraph cluster_node1 {
        rank=same
        label="Node 1"
        ne1 [label="node-exporter"]
        fb1 [label="fluent-bit"]
    }
    subgraph cluster_node2 {
        label="Node 2"
        ne2 [label="node-exporter"]
        fb2 [label="fluent-bit"]
    }
    subgraph cluster_node3 {
        label="Node 3"
        ne3 [label="node-exporter"]
        fb3 [label="fluent-bit"]
    }

    prometheus [shape="cylinder"]
    ne1 -> prometheus [style=dashed]
    ne2 -> prometheus [style=dashed]
    ne3 -> prometheus [style=dashed]
    prometheus -> grafana

    loki -> grafana

    me [label="Me", shape="house"]
    grafana -> me
}
```

#### Reflection

This was my first foray into Kubernetes, and with a homelab, so despite all the
learning curves, I think I did great here! However, there were a lot of things
that I could have done better with this setup.

- **Ephemeral Kubernetes volumes.** I didn't have any centralized storage, or
  some kind of sane storage management, so whenever a Kubernetes pod died, it
  would lose all its data.
- **Mixed-architecture clustering is hard.** You may notice I had both ARM and
  x86 machines. Some Docker images only support one architecture at a time. It's
  very hard to do this. I do not recommend it.
- **Low-end machines could not support virtualization.** It was a stupid idea to
  run Proxmox on badtop with its Pentium and 4GB RAM.
- **No domain controller.** I wanted to set up FreeIPA, but I didn't have the
  resources to do it.

### v3 - Kubernetes-Focused Cloud

I decided to tear down my homelab and start anew, to fix all the issues I had
with v2. This included reinstalling Proxmox, as well.

This time, I had a similar stack, but with a few critical differences, making my
Kubernetes setup less painful.

#### On-Site Hardware

I dropped all the ARM machines. Mixed-architecture is too hard. Additionally,
for some machines, I installed k3s on bare metal.

#### Infrastructure Services

Note that this time I actually managed DNS! This was done by having External DNS
update FreeIPA's server with Kubernetes Ingress entries. See
[this post](/2021/04/17/0/k8s-freeipa-dns) for more information.

FreeIPA managed the `s.astrid.tech` and `p.astrid.tech` namespaces, where `s`
stands for **service** and `p` stands for **private**. I would register FreeIPA
clients on the `p` namespace, and internal services on the `s` namespace (like
`longhorn.s.astrid.tech`, `firefly.s.astrid.tech`, `grafana.s.astrid.tech`...)

#### Monitoring

I used the same exact stack as in v2 with minimal modifications.

#### Reflection

There were lots of good things about v3. Some of the good things were:

- Kubernetes storage was a lot simpler now that I had Longhorn.
- I ended up deploying more services and it was a lot nicer to deploy them.

However, there were some bad things as well:

- You may notice that I dropped a lot of services. I planned to deploy them but
  never ended up doing it.
- The FreeIPA VM ate a lot of RAM. I didn't have as much capacity to deploy my
  services as a result.
- Most of this was still manually set up. The Kubernetes cluster, for example,
  was manually set up using `k3sup`.
- My Oracle Cloud VPS was still deploying using v1!

### v4 - Attempts at fully-automated deployment

I tore down my homelab again. This time, I wanted to automate as much as
possible. My primary goals were:

- after installing the OSes on the bare metal machines, I can set all of them up
  by executing a single command
- to create a more GitOps-like workflow where I can automatically deploy
  _everything_, simply by pushing my configs to `main`

#### Experiments with Ansible-based automated infrastructure bootstrapping

My first attempts revolved around a core idea: what if I had a central Ansible
playbook that would do everything for me?

To reduce configuration drift, I also attempted to set up Packer. The rest of
this section is coming soon...

#### NixOS!

I don't exactly remember when I first found out about Nix, but it was sometime
last year. It seemed like an interesting concept, but I didn't use it as
anything more than a package manager with unstable/bleeding-edge packages. At
some point, I wanted to distrohop BANANA (it was on Ubuntu at the time). Arch
Linux and NixOS were my top two candidates to hop to.

Unfortunately, I had an extremely weird partitioning scheme involving Windows
dual-boot, ext4, and a strange LVM topology, so I couldn't figure out how to
configure Nix to work with it at the time. Additionally, I didn't want to spend
much time learning the Nix language at that moment as I was lazy, and I was more
interested in having a functional[^fn-5] computer again. I ended up installing
Arch, and it seems to mostly work!

However, while researching how to automatically bootstrap and update my cluster,
I met [Vika](https://fireburn.ru/) in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) IRC.
She told me about her
[Nix-based setup](https://gitlab.com/vikanezrimaya/nix-flake), and I realized
that NixOS was perfect for what I was trying to do!

So, I turned my infra repo into a Nix flake, installed NixOS on Bongus, and that
leads us to my current setup.

[^fn-5]: No, not like Nix functional, I mean _working_ functional.
