Short for "Inventory Tree."

I have a messy room with too many disorganized things in random places. This
program will (hopefully) allow me to keep track of things better with the power
of QR codes.

[An attempt was made back in 2018](https://github.com/ifd3f/inv5026) to
implement something similar, but it failed due to my lack of experience.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- Django and Python 3
- It's literally just a REST API

### Frontend

- React as the main frontend framework
- Axios for those API calls
- Typescript because I kinda like it when VSCode can give me suggestions for my
  massive objects
- Bootstrap to make things look fabulous
