At FIRST Robotics Competition events, teams usually scout matches that other
teams play to find potential alliance partners. Electronic scouting records are
simply easier to perform statistical analysis on than paper records, but at most
events, Wi-Fi hotspots are prohibited. This means you can't use Google Drive or
a custom website unless you want to depend on expensive data plans or have all
the scouts work on one computer. Thus, you need to use different communication
protocols.

This app was able to communicate data between multiple phones using a
server-client architecture. It was eventually scrapped because I decided it was
too difficult to finish in the few months I had before competition.
