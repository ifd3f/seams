instructions:
  - info:
      Roughly chop the tomato, onion, and cilantro enough such that they fit in
      the food processor.
    duration: PT10M
  - info:
      Squeeze the lime into the food processor. Throw the tomato, onion, green
      onion, garlic, jalapeno, pepper, salt, cumin, and cilantro into the food
      processor. Process until they're thoroughly mixed, and you have raw salsa.
    duration: PT5M
  - info:
      Take the raw salsa and put it in the pan and heat until it boils. **You
      may want to put a lid on the pan to prevent salsa from popping out.** Let
      it boil for 10 minutes.
    duration: PT15M
  - info:
      You can let it cool or serve it hot. Probably better to let it cool first,
      though.
